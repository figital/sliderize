#sliderize

* this is probably the first jquery thing i ever wrote (translation: ugly and bad)

* i'd like to rewrite from scratch, then possibly turn into a plugin.

* the point is to enable smooth transitions between messages of different heights.

index.html is clean. css is clean. old script technically works. now time to refactor the moldy js file.
